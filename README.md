This project was scaffolded without internet access. It sets up a basic **Next.js** app using the modern `app/` router, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app. The home page displays a heading styled with Tailwind to confirm the setup is working.
