# Mrcto Marketing

This project was scaffolded without internet access. It sets up a basic **Next.js** app using the modern `app/` router, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

The site promotes responsible AI adoption for enterprises and small businesses. It includes a home page with a short overview and a services page describing how we can help with data protection, workflow integration, telemetry and ROI projections.
The app also includes a lightweight analytics toolset. Page views and custom events are sent to a local `/api/analytics` endpoint so you can measure engagement without relying on external services.


**Disclaimer:** Generative AI can produce incorrect or misleading content, so results should always be reviewed by humans.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app. The home page displays a heading styled with Tailwind to confirm the setup is working.
